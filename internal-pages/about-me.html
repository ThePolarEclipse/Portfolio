                <h2>About me</h2>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Hi, my name is Richard and I'm a web developer, coder, writer and designer.</p>
                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>I've been coding for a decade now, starting from highschool with computer science and learning some PHP to then going to college for games design &amp; development, where I learnt proper coding structure and familiarised myself with C++, C# and JavaScript. After leaving education I took up personal projects that range from game making to creating massive spreadsheets as well as plugins that use Python.<br><br>Alongside personal projects, I have been partaking in online courses for web development, mainly the <a class="scheme-link" href="scs-scheme.html">SCS Scheme</a>.</p>
                <h3>Interests and Hobbies</h3>
                <p>In my free time I like to be creative. This can range from coding something to designing or even just filling a spreadsheet with information.<br><br>I've always enjoyed making things and as I grew up, that manifested into various aspects of my life. For example, I have coded software that can turn a sprite sheet into a gif by reading various files. Another example would be when I created an entire world of stories. I put that all on a spreadsheet but later, as I learnt web development, I transferred that data into a stylised and professional information page.</p>
